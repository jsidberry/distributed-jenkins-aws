# distributed-jenkins-aws
The end result of this project is to have a distributed Jenkins setup that will function the backbone of a CI/CD pipeline for software development.

This project uses several technologies used in the principles of DevOps. 
- **AWS** : data-center platform to host the infrastructure.
- **Terraform** : infrastructure-as-code (IaC) used to build and maintain the infrastructure
- **Ansible** : configuration management (CM) used to install and configure the tools, like Jenkins, on the hosts machines
- **Jenkins** : the main tool used for the continuous integration & continuous deployment/delivery CI/CD functionality

I personally use this repo for initial builds for othe projects.
